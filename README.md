# tf2op-autobump
Auto-bumps TF2 Outpost trades, obviously prohibited, don't use.

You need to have Ruby installed to use this. Download the .rb and cookies file, set the uhash in the cookies file to the uhash value in your web browser's cookies. Do the same for the hash value in the Ruby file. Then, run the Ruby file on the command line.

Note: my [newer script](https://github.com/williamyeny/tf2outpost-autobump) is much easier to set up.
